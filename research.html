<p>I'm interested in Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and how Machine Learning can be used to solve problems from those areas.</p>

<p>I'm Ph.D. candidate at <a href="http://tecnico.ulisboa.pt/en/" target="_blank">Instituto Superior Técnico</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://web.ist.utl.pt/mario.gaspar.silva/" target="_blank"> Prof. Mário J. Gaspar da Silva </a></p>

<b>Thesis</b><br>
<br>
<p>Document collections hold important information expressed in natural language. Transforming text into structured data makes it possible to construct knowledge bases, which can be explored through queries and data analyses.</p>

<p>My research focuses on how to extract information from document collections (i.e, news archives, scientific articles, etc.). Concretely, on how extract named-entities (i.e, persons, organizations, locations, etc.) and relationships among them.</p>

<p>Within the context of my thesis I have explored supervised, distantly supervised and semi-supervised bootstrapping methods for semantic relationship extraction.</p>
