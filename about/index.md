I graduated from [Faculty of Sciences], [University of Lisbon], and between 2005 and 2006 I did two semesters as an exchange student at the [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT)] (former Universität Karlsruhe) under the Erasmus program.

After graduation, and before I starting my master, I worked as a software developer for [Nokia Siemens Networks].

My [master thesis (in portuguese)] done at the [XLDB], consisted in developing an information extraction system, which generates geographic summaries.
Each summary lists geographic entities found in a document linked (i.e., disambiguated) to a [geographic ontology]. The system was applied to a [crawl of the Portuguese Web] using a Hadoop cluster.
