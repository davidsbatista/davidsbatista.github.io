I'm a software developer with experience in Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and how Machine Learning can be used to solve specific problems from these areas.


Currently I'm a researcher at INESC-ID and a I'm Ph.D. candidate at Instituto Superior Técnico under the supervision of Professor Mário Jorge Gaspar da Silva. 


My thesis deals with semantic relationship extraction from large document collections. My approach consists of using a supervised on-line classifier based on min-hash and locality sensitive hashing. The training data for this classifier is gathered by a bootstrapping approach relying on distributional word representations (i.e. word2vec).
