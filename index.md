I'm a software developer with experience and interested in Information Extraction, Information Retrieval, Natural Language Processing and how Machine Learning can be used to solve specific problems from these areas.


Currently I'm a researcher at [INESC-ID] and a I'm Ph.D. candidate at [Instituto Superior Técnico] under the supervision of [Professor Mário Jorge Gaspar da Silva]. 


My thesis deals with semantic relationship extraction from large document collections. My approach consists of using a supervised on-line classifier based on min-hash and locality sensitive hashing. The training data for this classifier is gathered by a bootstrapping approach relying on distributional word representations (i.e. word2vec).

Tiago is excited by concurrency theory and parallel programming. In
his Ph.D. thesis, entitled [Programming Multicores Safely], Tiago
proposed two techniques to handle barrier deadlocks: a deadlock-free
programming interface, and a runtime verification tool, called
[Armus]. Recently, he has been interested in using [Coq] and [Why3] to
produce certified algorithms.

Past experience, includes being a research assistant at [Imperial
College London], where he was supervised by [Nobuko Yoshida], and a
visiting scholar at [Rice University], where he was supervised by
[Vivek Sarkar]. Tiago received his Ph.D., March '15, at [ULisboa],
where he was advised by [Francisco Martins], and his B.Sc. at
[Universidade dos Açores].
