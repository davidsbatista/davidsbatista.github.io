I love to play with data and extract knowledge from large volumes of data, be it structured or unstructured, numbers or text. I hold a [Ph.D. in Natural Laguange Processing and Machine Learning], you can see my [Curriculum Vitae] for more details, or check the [Background] section.

I have a strong interest in the following topics:

* Natural Language Processing
* Machine Learning and Deep Learning
* Information Extraction (e.g.: Named-Entity Recognition, Relationship Extraction)
* Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis
* Big Data

Currently I'm working at [HelloFresh AG] in Berlin.
