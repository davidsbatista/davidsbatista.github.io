I'm a computer science researcher at [INESC-ID],  I love to play with data and extract knowledge from large volumes of datasets, be they structured or unstructured, text or numbers.

I'm interested in the following research topics:

* Natural Language Processing
* Machine Learning
* Information Extraction
* Big Data

I'm also a Ph.D. candidate at [Instituto Superior Técnico] under the supervision of [Professor Mário Jorge Gaspar da Silva]. My thesis deals with large-scale [semantic relationship extraction] from document collections (e.g., newspapers archieves, scientific articles).

My proposal consists of extracting relationships with an [on-line supervised classifier] based on [min-hash] and [locality sensitive hashing], and generating training data for this classifier by a bootstrapping approach relying on distributional word representations (i.e. [word embeddings]).
